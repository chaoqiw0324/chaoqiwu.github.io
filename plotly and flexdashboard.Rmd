This parge is about making plotly
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Let's look at the NYC airbnb data


```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb <- 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location/2) %>% 
  select(neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood,stars,price,room_type,lat,long) %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(stars)
```

## Make a scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    text_label = str_c("Price:$",price,"\nRating:",stars)
  ) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color =  ~price,text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5
  )
```
